# The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors

Application Description:
This application runs a rock, paper, scissor game. The player is given three choices to choose from. Once a selection has been made the computer picks a choice at random to respond. First player to reach 5 wins, wins the whole game. 

Technologies Used:
I used html and css to style the three different pages presented in the application. I found this to be the best approach to create the pages this way due to my limited knowledge on JavaScript at the time.
Javascript was used to manipulate the logic of the flow of the game. As well as the logic behind the buttons presented in the game.

Challenges Faced: 
Due to my limited knowledge on JavaScript at the time, I styled all three pages presented in the application with HTML and CSS. The buttons that lead to the other pages are simply href links to a different directory. I find now creating and styling a page through JavaScript is more efficient.
